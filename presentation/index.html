                        <li>1998 W3C froze HTML standard at 4.01 and the era of XML begun</li>
                        <li>Transitional phase of XHTML started and XHTML Strict was the ultimate goal</li>
                        <li>W3C then began work on XHTML 2.0 which would have been completely backwards incompatible</li>
                        <li>2003 Guys at Opera were sure that XML was not the road to salvation</li>
                        <li>They began POC work extending HTML Form Tags without breaking backwards compatibility. This POC evolved to Web Forms 2.0</li>
                        <li>This team led by Ian Hickson soon gained momentum as Mozilla and Apple became interested</li>

                        <li>2004 WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) was formed by Apple, Mozilla and Opera</li>
                        <li>2005 Hickson moved to Google to continue the work under the name Web Applications 1.0</li>
                        <li>2006 W3C resurrected HTML Working Group and decided to use WHATWG spec as a foundation</li>
                        <li>W3C group roster included players like Sam Ruby of IBM, Chris Wilson of Microsoft and Majiec Stachowiak of Apple</li>
                        <li>Inventor of JavaScript and Mozilla CTO Brendan Eich, WebKit and Safari Architect David Hyatt and inventor of CSS and Opera CTO Håkon Wium Lie joined Hicksons team at WHATWG</li>

                        <li>2009 W3C discontinued XHTML 2.0 and reverted all resources towards HTML5</li>
                        <li>The philosophies of backwards compatibility, clean design and “not breaking the web” made it clear that HTML5 was the direction to go.</li>

                    The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links. Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element only sections that consist of major navigation blocks are appropriate for the nav element. In particular, it is common for footers to have a list of links to various key parts of a site, but the footer element is more appropriate in such cases, and no nav element is necessary for those links.

                    CSS preprocessors take code written in the preprocessed language and then convert that code into the same old css we’ve been writing for years. Because they aren’t css, they aren’t bound by the limitations of css.The preprocessed language can give you more functionality than css as long as it eventually makes sure everything is output as css and works in a browser like we expect.

                    Responsive Web Design (RWD) essentially indicates that a web site is crafted to use W3C CSS3 media queries with fluid proportion-based grids, to adapt the layout to the viewing environment, and probably also flexible images. As a result, users across a broad range of devices and browsers will have access to a single source of content, laid out so as to be easy to read and navigate with a minimum of resizing, panning and scrolling.
